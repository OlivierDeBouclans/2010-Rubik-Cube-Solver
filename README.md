## Description

#### When

I made this project in **2010**, spreading on all the **second year of preparatory school**. The topic of this school project was "surface".

#### What

With another student we decided to choose the Rubick’s Cube resolution using a surface representation. So I developed a program to solve a Rubick’s Cube using this representation.  As we didn’t know how complex it would be, we decide to start with the 2x2x2 version of the Rubick’s Cube. In the end, it took us all year to solve it.

#### How

This project was developed in **Maple**. It’s a software for mathematical study like Mathematica (or even Matlab) which works with worksheet. The graphical representation was done using graph drawing.

#### Note

Sadly you won’t be able to try the program unless you have Maple installed on your computer. I couldn’t  include it in repository for obvious reasons.
